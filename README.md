# Everything2ALAC – *An Exercise in Futility*
*Built Once, Abandoned Forever*
---

Welcome to **Everything2ALAC**, the ALAC converter you definitely didn’t need but now have anyway. I built this while waiting for my friend to finish walking his dog so we could play **Valorant** (because nothing says "life well spent" like 40 rounds of **Valorant** and the sweet embrace of **Vanguard** spyware). Now it’s here, and it’ll probably outlast my will to maintain it.

### 🌟 Features (I guess?):

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Drag files or entire folders onto the EXE, and it’ll *attempt* to convert them. Sure, it might crash or make you question your life choices, but what doesn’t these days?
  
- **Batch Processing**: Why stop at one file when you can make this converter mindlessly churn through a whole folder? It’s like watching paint dry, except instead of paint, it’s *WAVs* and *FLACs*, and instead of dry, you get ALAC files. Life’s short, so why not spend it waiting for pointless conversions?

- **File Renaming**: It automatically adds `[Everything2ALAC]` to your files because I think you deserve a constant reminder of the bad decisions that brought you here.

### 🚀 How to Use (If You Insist):

1. **Step 1**: Download this. I don’t know why you’d want to, but it’s your life.
2. **Step 2**: Drag some files onto the EXE. Maybe they’ll convert, maybe they won’t. I honestly don’t care anymore.
3. **Step 3**: You now have ALAC files. Congratulations? They have `[Everything2ALAC]` slapped onto the file names because your library wasn't messy enough.

### ⚙️ Requirements (Good luck):

- **Windows**, because I wasn’t about to waste my time making this cross-platform. You think I care enough to support macOS or Linux? No.
- **QAAC Encoder & Dependencies**: Yeah, if you want to build this yourself, you’ll have to get the **QAAC encoder** and all the **DLLs**. I’m not spoon-feeding you. Figure it out, just like you’re figuring out why you’re still here.
- Enough **hard drive space** to store lossless audio files, because what better way to fill the void than with 300MB versions of songs you’ll never listen to?

---

### 📜 Disclaimer (Read this. Or don’t. Nothing matters):

- **No Bug Fixes**: There will be **no updates**. I’m never committing to this again. If it breaks, well, life breaks you down too. Learn to live with disappointment.
- **I Don’t Care**: If this tool somehow causes you to spiral into an existential crisis, well, same. I feel that every day, and I didn’t even have to download this.
- **Liability**: If this software corrupts your files or your will to live, that’s on you for trusting it.

### Why Did I Build This?

Because I had time to kill while waiting for my mate to finish walking his dog. Instead of doing something productive like staring at a wall, I built **Everything2ALAC**. I was just trying to pass time before playing **Valorant** (which, by the way, involves **Vanguard**, so my data’s probably already in some server on the other side of the world). 

I regret everything.

### Contributing (Just Don’t):

If you feel compelled to improve this for some godforsaken reason, go ahead and fork it. But if you open an issue expecting me to respond, I’ve got bad news for you—I won’t. This project is a cry for help, and unfortunately, help’s not coming.

---

### Building It Yourself (If You Hate Yourself Enough):

1. First, you need to grab the **QAAC encoder** and its lovely array of dependencies. I could’ve bundled them for you, but I didn’t, because that would’ve required effort.
2. Once you have **qaac64.exe** and the **DLLs** (which you’ll have to hunt down on your own), you can try building it. Or don’t. Honestly, it doesn’t matter.

---

### License (Sure, Whatever):

MIT License. Do what you want with this disaster of a project. Fork it, improve it, delete it from existence. None of it will fill the void, but at least you’ll have ALAC files.

Good luck, and remember—no one asked for this, least of all me.
